## DLC Instructions:

1. Dump your installed Puyo Puyo Tetris DLC using GodMode9, Decrypt9WIP, etc.
2. Download [CTRTool](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR/releases/latest/) and [3DSTool](https://github.com/dnasdw/3dstool/releases/latest/).
3. Place ctrtool.exe, makerom.exe, and 3dstool.exe in the "Tools" folder.
4. Rename your DLC to "0004008C00101200.cia" and Place it in the "Tools" folder as well. Also, make sure the .CIA has been decrypted.
5. Run "1_Extract_CIA.bat". Check file for correct naming.
6. (Optional) Run "2_Delete_DummyData.bat", none of this data will be rebuilt, so it's pointless to keep it.
7. Run "3_Extract_DLC.bat".
8. Copy and merge all the files from the "DLC files" folder with the extracted DLC.
9. Run "4_Build_DLC.bat".
10. Run "5_Build_CIA.bat".
11. Install and enjoy!
